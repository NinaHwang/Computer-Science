# Secure Programming Philosophy

## General Philosophy

Program defensively

- what could someone deliberately/unintentionally do to compromise your program, or the system it runs on?

Understand the environment in which your program will be used

Understand the procedures under which people will use your program

## Defining Secure Programming

If program is not robust it's not going to be secure ⇒ robustness는 security의 필요조건

Is the program in the environment in which I'm using it and with the procedures I'm following secure? ⇒ key question!

### Key Concepts

**privilege**: Running with rights other than those obtained by logging in; or running as *superuser/root/admin*..

**protection domain**: all objects to which the process has access, and the type of access the process has

- If I can read a file: my protection domain includes that file + read right
- If i can alter a file: my protection domain includes that file + write right

## Robust vs. Secure Programming

### Robust Programming/Code

A style of programming that prevents abnormal termination or unexpected actions

Handles bad input(error) gracefully

- ex) gives  an error message

Detects internal errors and handles them gracefully

- On failure, provides information to aid in recovery or analysis

A robust program deals with whether or not it'll crash, whether or not it can be corrupted and so forth, but it doesn't necessarily deal with the violation of security

⬄ Fragile programming/code

### Secure Programming

"Secure" program conforms to a security policy

- And implicitly requires robustness

### Quality of Code

Underlying all this is programming

- When coding, you make assumptions about services, systems, input, output
- Other components you rely on have bugs or may act unexpectedly

Hard to have robust, secure software when the infrastructure isn't robust or secure

## Security Policies and Procedures

### Security is Cumulative

Composing non-secure modules produces non-secure software

Can ameliorate this with software shims to handle non-secure results

- Shims provide the security
- What if they themselves are written installed, etc., non-securely?
- What if they can be bypassed?

> In computer programming, a shim is a library that transparently intercepts API calls and changes the arguments passed, handles the operation itself or redirects the operation elsewhere.

Refactor code, use external libraries, modules, services

- **You inherit their bugs and assumptions!**
- ex) RSAREF2 library buffer overflow ⇒ affected *ssh*, anything using that library
- Move code into different environment, assumptions may not hold

### Policies and Procedures

Policies and procedures defined and enhanced security

The policy defines that the procedures or mechanisms for ensuring the polices carried out

Ignore these

- Program will be used in a wide variety of environments
- Write it to check any environmental assumptions

Consider these

- Focus here is on use of program in particular environment with a certain set of procedures

## Secure Programming General Philosophy

Goal: To show you where to look for problems in security-related programs; in essence, to get you thinking like an attacker ⇒ What to look at? What to look for?

Always check your assumptions

Don't be afraid to think sideways

### Basic Rule: Find Assumptions!

Implicit in all security

- Often about what is trusted

Attacks based on these

- Ask what happens if the assumption is wrong ⇒ If program does something undesirable, continue

Ask how to make assumption wrong

**Look at Manual for Programs**

- In many ways, good and accurate manuals tell you many assumptions the program or system makes

### General Thoughts

Look at interactions with (internal & external) components

- Anything involving user I/O
- Anything involving network interactions
- Anything involving dependencies

Cryptography

Access control checking, especially credentials

Cleaning up(or not cleaning up)

Being too helpful

- 로그인 실패시 에러메시지.. 어느 정보가 잘못되었는지 알려줄 필요?

## Checking Design and Implementation

### Check Program Design

Network accesses are in well-defined modules that check interactions

- Network accesses should not be scattered throughout the program ⇒ they should be in one or a small set of modules and each of those modules have appropriate checking code

System resource accesses are protected, done appropriately, and checked

Module interfaces well-defined, clear

### Watch Out For..

Inputs defined, checked

- Especially critical if inputs are a command language and not data
- If commands input, how is their execution constrained?

Validate identities

- For users, groups, roles, other types of entities
- Naming conflicts

### Check Implementation

Common errors

- Buffer overflows
- Use of "little languages" (form of checking input)
- Race conditions
- Error handling
- Changing privileges
- Any use of cyptography
    - Especially locally written crypto routines and protocols
- Environment variables/registry data(form of input checking)
- Improper use of library functions
- Dependencies on other programs
- Undefined characteristics

Look at change log

## Where to Look for Vulnerabilities

Network servers: unknown users can access them

Local servers: they perform acts normal users cannot

Anything where privileges or rights are changed

- ex) setuid/setgid; changing protection domains

Shared resources: privileged and unprivileged users both user theses

- availability: someone can interfere with someone else's use of resources
- confidentiality, integrity

### Network Servers

Accessible from throughout the network

Gives access to system

- attacker may not have access to account on target

Usually has privileges of some kind

- root or daemon; may be only that of ordinary user
    - but you can usually get whatever you need from any of these

May make bogus assumptions

- Weak authentication(identity from IP address)

May be poorly written

### Local Servers

Accessible through system entry point: usually socket, shared directory, shared files

Usually has privileges of some kind: root, daemon, or some other system user

May make bogus assumptions

- Determine requester's identity from ancillary information

Initial environment may be poorly configured

May be poorly written

### Setuid, Setgid Programs

Execute with privileges other than that of user

Executes in user's environment: User's environment may be incorrectly configured

Usually has privileges of some kind: root, daemon, or some other system user

May make bogus assumptions

- Determine requester's identity from ancillary information

May be poorly written

### Clients

Connect to local/remote servers

May not check input thoroughly

- Browsers may pass environment information via command strings
- If client is remote, can attack remote system with no other information beyond the server's existence

Need not be privileged

- Client connects to privileged programs

May be poorly written
